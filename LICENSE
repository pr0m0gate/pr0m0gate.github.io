Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to make their Work available for use by others, while
restricting certain uses, including commercial uses, adaptations, and
derivative works. The person associating this license with a Work (the
"Affirmer") voluntarily elects to apply the Creative Commons Attribution-
NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (the "License") to
the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge
of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning
and intended legal effect of the License on those rights.

By using this License, the Affirmer permits others to:

1. **Copy and redistribute** the material in any medium or format for
   non-commercial purposes, as long as they **attribute the Work** to the
   Affirmer, and do not make any **derivative works** from it.

2. **No Commercial Use**: The Work may not be used for commercial
   purposes.

3. **No Derivatives**: The Work may not be modified, adapted, or
   transformed into a derivative work without the express permission of
   the Affirmer.

4. The above conditions are meant to ensure that the work remains
   available for the benefit of the public and that it is not altered or
   used commercially without permission.

1. Copyright and Related Rights

     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work;
  v. database rights;
 vi. and other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national

To the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, the Affirmer imposes
the following restrictions on the use of the Work:

  i. The Work may not be used for commercial purposes.

obtained prior written permission from the Affirmer.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
     surrendered, or licensed by this document.
  b. The Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
     warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
     statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
     title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
     infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,
     or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all
     to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
  c. The Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
     persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including
     without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
     Work. The Affirmer is not responsible for obtaining any necessary
     consents, permissions, or other rights required for any use of the
     Work.

under applicable law, the remainder of the License shall remain in effect.
